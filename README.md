ratemyproject
=============

Project rating system for developing work goals.

Use two axes: feasibility and interest. 

Feasibility = length of time to complete including learning all necessary skills, data collection, analyses and writing
Interest = "distance from the known shores and by the amount in which they increase the verifiable knowledge"

The 3-month Rule = Don't commit to a project for three months and celebrate both the initiation and the completion of the project.

Use a paradigm that will allow for circuitous and opportunistic research.
